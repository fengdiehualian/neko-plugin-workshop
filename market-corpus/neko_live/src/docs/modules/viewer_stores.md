# Viewer And Security Stores

## Purpose

This store slice keeps viewer profiles, audit events, and encrypted platform credentials behind explicit single-writer boundaries. It adds safe profile projections and maintenance actions, bounded audit records with secret redaction, and isolated credential namespaces for multiple live providers.

## Ownership And Contracts

- `stores/viewer_store.py` is the only writer for `viewer_profiles.json`. It sanitizes loaded records, serializes writes with an async lock, uses atomic replacement, and does not call the memory server. It retains bounded, filtered viewer utterances in impression fields; this is not a full chat archive. `core/viewer_preferences.py` drops presence boilerplate before it becomes an impression: entry/like/follow system lines, connectivity probes (`测试`, `测试一下`, `能不能收到`, `看得到吗`), and platform auto-hints carrying `以后不提示`. Ordinary questions that merely contain `能不能` still count as preferences. Tests: `tests/test_viewer_profile_quality.py`. Longer recall of a viewer's own words goes through `adapters/live_memory_bridge.py` into N.E.K.O `scoped_history`.
- `stores/audit_store.py` is the only audit-event sink. It bounds text, nesting, and list sizes and redacts sensitive text and structured sensitive keys.
- `stores/credential_store.py` owns Fernet-encrypted credential files. The default `bili` namespace preserves legacy filenames while other providers use strictly validated, isolated filenames and field allowlists. Audit identity uses `DedeUserID` for Bili fields and `uid` for provider field sets that expose it; missing identities are recorded explicitly as `unidentified`, never as an empty account id. Missing credential files load silently as logged out; a present-but-unreadable store (wrong key, corrupt file, invalid payload) also loads as logged out but records `{namespace}_credential_load_failed` with only `error_type` (exception class name), so "decrypt failed" is distinguishable from "never logged in" without exposing ciphertext or key material.
- `core/viewer_preferences.py` owns preference inference and the public profile projection returned by `recent_profiles()`.

Store callers receive plain public dictionaries or contract objects. Viewer mutations require a sanitized provider identity. This identity is part of the existing product contract: `viewer_profiles.json` uses the sanitized value both as the JSON key and as the profile `uid` field; it is not an opaque or cross-provider anonymous identifier. Bili credential audit identity uses `DedeUserID`, while other provider credential fields use an allowlisted `uid` when available. Removing or hashing this persistent profile identity requires a separate schema migration; disabling personalized memory does not rewrite existing identity keys. Credential callers only receive the configured encrypted payload fields.

## Pipeline, Safety, And Data

Viewer data is derived from compact identity and interaction metadata after normal live-event handling. Store operations do not emit NEKO output. Any response using profile guidance still enters `core/pipeline.py`, passes `core/safety_guard.py`, and reaches NEKO only through `adapters/neko_dispatcher.py`.

Viewer profiles contain local nicknames, avatar URLs, counters, compact preference summaries, and recent output summaries. Audit records must never retain cookies, tokens, authorization values, or provider credentials. Credential plaintext exists only in memory during encrypted save/load and must never enter audit, logs, config, or UI.

Personalized viewer memory defaults to enabled. The switch controls local preference/utterance learning, personalized prompt use, and scoped-history collection/submission; basic identity, interaction counters, first-roast state, and same-session anti-repeat remain active. Profiles expire after 90 days of inactivity and are pruned lazily at startup and during normal store traffic. Local impression fields can retain selected original words. Host-memory retention is governed by the host, independently of the local 90-day policy. No background cleanup loop is added.

## Decision Point: Viewer Memory V1

- **Approved product behavior:** default on; fixed 90-day retention; ordinary-user toggle, clear-all, reset-impression, and delete-profile controls.
- **Cost budget:** bounded local JSON I/O and existing prompt tokens when enabled. The existing scoped-history bridge also sends local HTTP requests to the host memory service; extraction cost is determined by the host. No new model API, dependency, timer, `watch_time`, or `contribution_rank` is introduced by the review fixes.
- **Action semantics:** reset removes local impressions and preserves identity, counts, and first-roast state; delete removes the complete persistent UID record and its session claim; clear-all affects local profiles and unsent memory batches, not summaries, sandbox results, or safety queues. Delete/reset cancel unsent batches for the UID. None of these actions purges memory already accepted by the host.
- **Rejected alternatives:** disabling the basic profile store with personalization would break first-roast dedup; background retention jobs add idle cost; retaining raw history increases privacy and migration risk.
- **Degrade / rollback:** setting `viewer_memory_enabled=false` immediately stops learning and prompt use while preserving the basic live contract. Existing JSON remains schema-compatible if the UI controls are rolled back.
- **Evidence:** config projection, disabled-learning, prompt gating, 90-day pruning, reset/delete/clear, panel parity, locale, and full plugin gates cover this decision.

## Testing

Run:

```powershell
uv run pytest plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_viewer_store.py plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_credential_store.py plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_audit_store.py -q
uv run pytest plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests -q --maxfail=1
uv run python -m plugin.neko_plugin_cli.cli check plugin/plugins/neko_live
```

Tests cover JSON persistence and fallback, disabled-memory behavior, 90-day retention, profile reset/delete/clear behavior, prompt gating, encrypted namespace isolation, and redaction of secrets in text and nested structured audit detail.

## Limitations And Rollback

- Viewer profiles are local plugin data and do not provide cross-device synchronization.
- Profile mutations still read and atomically rewrite the canonical JSON file. The bounded dashboard projection removes repeated read/parse work but does not turn JSON into an indexed database; very large 90-day profile sets may still add latency to an individual selected interaction. A storage-engine migration remains a separate decision.
- Ordinary profile updates degrade to the plugin data directory when a configured viewer directory cannot be written. A durable ownership marker binds fallback selection to the configured source so restarts use the latest database. Each custom source has its own hashed fallback data file; an unclaimed custom path never imports or overwrites the ordinary default database. Earlier explicit markers migrate to the separate file on the next write, retaining the shared original for recovery. Old pre-marker fallback files remain untouched and require explicit recovery when their source is unknown. Maintenance writes to that authoritative fallback; marker/write failures fail closed. Restoring the old code requires migrating the fallback back to the configured path first to avoid reading stale data.
- Missing or undecryptable credential files degrade to a logged-out state.
- Rolling back the maintenance APIs leaves existing profile JSON compatible. Rolling back provider namespaces must retain the default `bili_credential.*` files; other namespace files can remain unused without exposing plaintext.


## Scoped Memory Lifecycle

`LiveMemoryBridge` collects only sanitized viewer text from successful live submissions. A `queued_to_neko(...)` receipt is never an assistant turn. The bridge binds target role, provider platform, session generation and UID at collection time. It uses participant subjects such as `twitch:123`, without a second Bilibili prefix. This provides write isolation, not automatic cross-platform identity binding or guaranteed host recall.

`core/viewer_utterance.py` is the shared eligibility rule for local utterance learning/counts and scoped-history collection: authored `live_danmaku` chat includes ordinary danmaku, SC bodies and provider-verified Twitch cheer text. Entry/follow/like, generic gift/subscription descriptions, missing-SC-body fallback labels, synthetic hosting and developer simulation do not add utterances or personal preferences; identity upsert and first-roast bookkeeping remain available. Busy-room batch welcomes learn the original selected danmaku, never the generated welcome intent. This does not erase older contaminated records or memories already accepted by the host.

HTTP success alone is not a memory acknowledgement. The bridge requires a JSON object with `status=processed` and `trust.persisted` exactly `true` or `null`; false, absent/incomplete blocks, numeric lookalikes, and malformed JSON retain the batch for a later flush with the same idempotency key. Successful keys are cached only after this confirmation. Retry uses the existing bounded batches and explicit flush/shutdown lifecycle, with no new timer or network polling. Local text checks and acknowledgement parsing add no model call, dependency or storage schema; disabling personalized memory remains the degrade path. Reverting acknowledgement validation restores the risk of losing unsaved trust/activity updates.

Collection and HTTP submission both check `viewer_memory_enabled`. Disabling discards queued batches and cancels owned requests; it cannot retract requests already accepted by the host. Batches contain six viewer turns. Capacity is bounded to 256 pending scopes, 12 turns per scope, eight owned requests and 1024 successful idempotency keys. Excess pending scopes evict the oldest unsubmitted scope; failed requests retain a bounded tail for a later flush. No periodic retry loop is added. Shutdown stops ingestion first, drains for at most two seconds, then cancels and awaits owned requests. A room disconnect (`disconnect_live_room`) also submits the pending partial batch through the bridge's existing `flush()`, bounded to two seconds with `asyncio.shield`, so a slow host never blocks the disconnect action and the shielded request finishes in the background. A timeout records audit `live_memory_flush_timeout`, a failure records `live_memory_flush_failed` with the exception type only; both leave the batch for the next flush or shutdown. This adds no timer or polling; it moves an existing submission earlier. Tests: `tests/test_runtime_live_controls.py -k disconnect`.

`test_review_memory_lifecycle.py` checks these rules against the real local profile store, ordinary-chat learning after system events, original text after batch welcoming, rejected/malformed HTTP acknowledgements, identical retry keys and confirmed-response dedupe. Local identity/profile writes continue through `ViewerStore`; no support ledger is added.

### Decision Points for further memory changes

The current review fixes restore the switch and ownership contract without adding model calls. Keep local deletion and host deletion explicitly separate until a host-supported scoped deletion API and identity authorization are agreed. Automatic fact extraction, cross-platform identity linking and independent retention changes require a separate cost/privacy decision. Rollback can disable personalized memory; preserve the fallback ownership marker and authoritative JSON when reverting store code.
