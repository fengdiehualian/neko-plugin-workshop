"""One normalized frame of World of Warships telemetry.

`WowsSnapshot` is the only shape the rest of the plugin sees. Whether the frame
arrived from a v1 service, a pre-envelope service, WebSocket or REST, everything
downstream reads the same fields and the same per-domain availability map.

The availability distinction is load-bearing: a domain that is `unknown` or
`stale` is *not* a negative reading. Detectors that need it are blocked instead
of concluding `false`, which is what keeps a dropped connection from looking
like "all enemies disappeared".
