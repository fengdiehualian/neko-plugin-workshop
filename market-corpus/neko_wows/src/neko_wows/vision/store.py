"""A small ring of recent frames on disk, addressed by opaque handle.

Why keep them at all: the picture is pulled out of conversation history at the
end of the turn that produced it, so without a store there is no way for the
character to look again. The handle in the tool output is what makes "let me
check that shot once more" possible.

Why handles and not paths: the game's in-battle chat is *in the frame*, so a
teammate can type anything they like into a picture the model reads. If the
recall tool accepted a path fragment, that would be a complete chain from
"teammate types a line" to "LLM reads an arbitrary local file, contents go to
the model provider". Handles are looked up in an in-memory table; the path is
only ever constructed here, and nothing from the caller reaches the
filesystem.
