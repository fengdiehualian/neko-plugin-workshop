"""Turning a window (or the whole screen) into a 720p JPEG.

Two backends, in order: Win32 ``PrintWindow`` asks the window to paint itself,
then ``mss`` may fall back to the window rectangle while the game is the
foreground window. ``mss`` reads whatever is physically on screen, so using it
for a background game could capture another application that overlaps it.

Compression goes through ``utils.screenshot_utils.compress_screenshot`` so a
battle frame is the same 720p JPEG q80 as every other screenshot in the app.
