"""Locating the World of Warships window.

Deliberately narrower than the capture stacks in ``galgame_plugin`` and
``study_companion``: this looks for one known process, does not feed OCR, and
does not need backend reordering for occluded windows. Importing their
plugin-private code across a plugin boundary is not a supported contract, so
this is a focused reimplementation rather than a fourth consumer of theirs.

Returning ``None`` is a normal outcome — the caller falls back to a full-screen
grab. The game not running, being minimized, or pywin32 being absent are all
just "no window", never an exception.
